A group of schoolchildren decided to go hiking along the Moscow River.
The Moscow River has many tributaries that can flow into it from both the right (R) and left (L) banks. 
The students want to start the hike at some point on the left bank and end the hike at some point on the right bank,
 perhaps crossing the rivers several times. As you know, crossing both the river and the tributary is a certain difficulty, 
so they want to minimize the number of crossings made.
The schoolchildren studied the map in advance and wrote down the sequence in which tributaries flow into the Moskva River along their entire route.
Use this description of the tributaries to help the students determine the minimum number of crossings they will have to make during the hike. Description of tributaries - a string consisting of a sequence of three characters R - right tributary, L - left tributary, B - tributaries to the right and left simultaneously.

Example input: LLBLRRBRL output: 5

Input format
One line of characters L, R, B. The characters in the string are not separated by anything.

Output format
One integer on the first line.
