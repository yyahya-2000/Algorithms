The PI student was lucky and got an internship at the main office of Yandex. Duration of the internship N days (N integer, 3 <= N <long). At the headquarters of the company, he visits the buffet every day and drinks a cup of coffee and syrup. The specialty of the buffet is that every day a new type of syrup is supplied to the buffet to entertain the trainees. On the first day of the internship, the student has one choice of syrup, on the second day, the student can drink coffee with the same syrup, or try a new one (we will encode them with numbers 1 and 2), on the third day there are already three types of syrup (their codes: 1, 2 and 3) available to the student. On the last day, the student has a choice of N different delicious syrups.

The student's choice during the entire internship can be coded with a string containing N codes for the different syrups that he chose every day.

The student has a variety of choices for syrups. From the option “select the first type of syrup each time” (line 1 1 1 1) to the option “select a new type of syrup each time” (line 1 2 3 N).

Your program should output the k-th student's choice for the given k and N. In this case, we proceed from the fact that the choice of syrups is generated by the program in lexicographic order.
