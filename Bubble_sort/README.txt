You need to implement non-decreasing bubble sorting and count the number of exchanges made when sorting.

Input format
The first line contains one integer N - the number of numbers to be sorted. The second line contains N positive integers not exceeding 100.
It is guaranteed that 0 â‰¤ N <100.

Output format
First, print the sorted array separated by a space, and then on a new line one number - the number of exchanges made when sorting the array.

Example 1

Input:
5
5 3 2 4 1

Output:
1 2 3 4 5
8

Example 2

Input: 
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output:
1 2 3 4 5
0
