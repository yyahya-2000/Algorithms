You need to implement non-decreasing binary insertion sorting and count the number of shifts of adjacent elements performed during sorting, while the number of shifts should be minimal.

Input format:
The first line contains one integer N - the number of numbers to be sorted. The second line contains N positive integers not exceeding one hundred.
It is guaranteed that 0 â‰¤ N <100.

Output format:
First, print the sorted array, separated by a space, and then on a new line, one number - the minimum number of shifts of adjacent elements, performed when sorting the array.

Example 1
Input:
5
5 2 1 4 3

Output:
1 2 3 4 5
6
Example 2
Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output:
1 2 3 4 5
0
