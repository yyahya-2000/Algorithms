You need to implement sorting by choosing the minimum in non-decreasing order and count the number of exchanges made when sorting.

Input format:
The first line contains one integer N - the number of numbers to be sorted. The second line contains N positive integers not exceeding one hundred.
It is guaranteed that 0 â‰¤ N <100.

Example 1
Input: 
5
5 4 1 3 2

Output:
1 2 3 4 5
4
Example 2
Input: 
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output:
1 2 3 4 5
0
