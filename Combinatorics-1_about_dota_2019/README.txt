Students of PI FKN gathered to play Dota.
Total students - N (0 <N <= 1000, N is even).
Several situations are considered below, for each program must return an answer:
(1) there are places in the computer labs for all students (N places), the program should return the number of ways in which all students can be accommodated in the computer labs;
(2) some of the computer classes are occupied, and there are only k places in the free computer classes (0 <k <N); students decide that they will draw lots to randomly choose k people who will play; the program should return the number of ways to select k students from all;
(3) in the third case, the students decided that they would play in pairs; there is space in computer labs; students need to pair up; the program should return the number of ways to form pairs of N students.
