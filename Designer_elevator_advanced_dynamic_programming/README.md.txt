Artemiy Indyukov's design studio received an order to develop an unusual elevator for a new skyscraper. Artemy himself took up the work, which is distinguished by a rare inadequacy. He has a fix idea: four buttons are enough to control the elevator. The buttons should be as follows:

- Climb A floors up

- Go up B floors

- Climb C floors up

- Go down to the first floor

The lift is originally located on the ground floor. The elevator passenger uses the first three buttons to get to the floor they want. If a passenger tries to go up A, B, or C floors, and such a floor does not exist in the building (i.e., the passenger wants to rise above the Nth, last floor), then the elevator does not go anywhere.

The customers of the project turned out to be with humor and, together with the rejection of the futuristic design, decided to assess the adequacy of Artemy on a scale from 1 to N. The assessment of the adequacy is equal to the number of floors that can be reached from the first with the help of such an elevator. Help them in this.

Input format
The first line contains the number N - the height of the skyscraper (1 <= N <= 500,000).

The second line contains three numbers A, B and C defining the parameters of the buttons (1 <= A, B, C <= 100,000).

Output format
Print a single number - the assessment of the adequacy of Artemiy Indyukov.
