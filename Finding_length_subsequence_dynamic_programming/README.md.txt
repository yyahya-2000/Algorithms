A subsequence is a list of elements in which their order plays a role. 
A specific element can appear multiple times in a subsequence. 
Subsequence Z of string X is string X, possibly with elements removed. For example, 
if X is a substring of ABC, then it has 8 subsequences ABC, AB, AC, BC, A, B, C and an empty string. If X and Y are strings, then Z is a common subsequence of X and Y if it is a subsequence of both strings. 
The terms "subsequence" and "substring" are not equivalent. A substring is a subsequence in which all characters are selected from contiguous positions in the string.
Problem: For two given strings X and Y, find the length of the longest common subsequence Z of strings X and Y.

Input format
The two lines of input contain the values ​​of lines X and Y.
Line lengths: 0 <= L <= 10000

Output format
Integer - length of the longest common subsequence of strings X and Y
